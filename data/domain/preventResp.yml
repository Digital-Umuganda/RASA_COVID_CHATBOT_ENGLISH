      confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips.\n
      Further development of the disease can lead to complications including pneumonia, acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and kidney failure.\n
      The likely order of initial symptoms of the COVID-19 disease is a fever followed by a cough 
      and muscle pain, and that nausea and vomiting usually appear before diarrhoea. 
      This contrasts with the most common path for influenza where it is common to develop a 
      cough first and fever later\n"

      infectivity of patients is limited.\n
